 An Experimental Study More Choices Makes You Better Off Is An Illusion
 
 • Designed an experiment to collect data from 120 students studying at USF. Findings were in parity with the theory of paradox of choices. It was seen that although people want more options, they are more likely to decide and be satisfied with the decision under less-options scenarios.
• Aggregate and analyze the raw data using R for analysis and Tableau for visualization, identifying the levels of satisfaction and optimality in decision when individual’s are presented with many choices.
